# Stacks_pipeline

The general workflow is to process an entire ddRADseq data set, from raw sequencing reads to creating input files for commonly used programs.

There are specific instructions in each subdirectory of this pipeline.

This pipeline was written for and tested on Stacks v1.35. If you are using a newer version, I can't guarantee this will be compatible.
